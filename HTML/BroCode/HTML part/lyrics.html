    <pre>
        A hopeless romantic all my life
        Surrounded by couples all the time
        I guess I should take it as a sign
        (Ah, why? Ah, why? Ah, why? Ah, why?)
        
        I'm feeling lonely (lonely)
        Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (hold me)
        Now I'm crying in my room
        So skeptical of love (say what you say, but I want it more)
        But still I want it more, more, more
        
        I gave a second chance to cupid
        But now I'm left here feeling stupid
        Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
        Cupid is so dumb
        
        I look for his arrows everyday
        I guess he got lost or flew away
        Waiting around is a waste (waste)
        Been counting the days since November
        Is loving as good as they say?
        
        Now I'm so lonely (lonely)
        Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (hold me)
        Now I'm crying in my room
        So skeptical of love (say what you say, but I want it more)
        But still I want it more, more, more
        
        I gave a second chance to cupid
        But now I'm left here feeling stupid
        Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
        Cupid is so dumb
        
        (Cupid is so dumb)
        
        Hopeless girl is seeking someone who will share this feeling
        I'm a fool, a fool for love, a fool for love
        
        I gave a second chance to cupid
        But now I'm left here feeling stupid
        Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
        Cupid is so dumb
        
        I gave a second chance to cupid
        But now I'm left here feeling stupid
        Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
        Cupid is so dumb</pre>
